# Germotion
Here you can find two scripts with an ruled-based approach, estimating emotional and sentimental value of text.

## Emotion Analysis
Up to seven diffrent emotions (Verachtung, Freude, Wut,...) will be detected. The outcome will be an array of detected emotion in percent.

## Sentiment Analysis
Gets the sentimental value from two dictionaries. Both dictionaries contain of words that have a certain value in range of -1 to +1 and represents the sentimental value. For example: "Begeisterung (enthusiasm): 0.32" and "Absturz (crash/fall): -0.47.
Of course positive value implies positive/good words.
